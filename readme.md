# Proportional Fitting aka Sample Balancing aka Raking

**Problem**: I have an non-representative convenience survey sample of 3000 students. I need a small sample for qualitative analysis that is more representative. 

**Target**: To draw a more representative subsample for qualitative analysis.

**Method**: 

1. Specify targed proportions for strata.
2. Store proportions in a list.
3. Use anesrake function
4. Add new weights to the dataset
5. Draw a weighted subsample from the dataset.
6. Check sample weights
